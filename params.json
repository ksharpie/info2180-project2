The object of the game is to arrange the tiles into numerical order by repeatedly sliding a square that neighbors the missing square into its empty space.\r\n\r\n### Game Functions\r\nWhen the mouse button is pressed on a puzzle square, if that square is next to the blank square, it is moved into the blank space. If the square does not neighbor the blank square, no action occurs. Similarly, if the mouse is pressed on the empty square or elsewhere on the page, no action occurs.Whenever the mouse cursor hovers over a square that can be moved (one that neighbors the blank square), its appearance changes. The shuffle button, shuffles the board and starts the timer",
